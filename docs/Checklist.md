# IgniteGigs - Project Checklist

> Phased, Skill-Driven Execution
> Generated by IdeaRalph • January 2025

## How This Checklist Works

This is a **living document** — use it throughout your project, not just at the end.

1. **Work through phases in order** (but some overlap is fine)
2. **Load the skill FIRST** before working on any section
3. **Check items off** only after skill-validated implementation
4. **Update regularly** as you progress
